Welcome!!
 In this project called Twitter Clon =  We can create, read, update, and destroy Tweets. Combined with this gem we can authenticate users    who want to author Tweeets. A user's Tweeets are then also tied to their account. The end result is a public facing site with a stream of  tweets from different users. Users that have and account can login to create their own Tweets to add to the public stream.
